- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrey
- 👀 I'm interested in programming. I work at my main job and decided to change my activity completely. At the moment I have studied the HTML language, CSS and have now switched to learning JavaScript. I think that it’s not right to completely immerse yourself in learning the next language, so I type out the pages, learning more and more about the languages I’ve already learned. For now, I’m practicing creating some light programs and games in JavaScript, as well as creating and laying out various landing pages and websites from Figma.
- 💞️ I'm looking for cooperation on HTML, CSS, Javascript. In principle, I will be glad to any cooperation if I can share my knowledge or learn something new.
