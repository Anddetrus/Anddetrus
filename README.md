- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrey
- 👀 I'm interested in programming. I'm working at my main job and decided to completely change careers. I've learned HTML, CSS, JS, and Python. I'm really looking to land an internship with the T-education team as a QA Engineer. I've taken many courses and completed practical assignments.
- 💞️ I'm looking for collaboration in HTML, CSS, JS and Python. I'm open to any collaboration where I can share my skills or learn something new!
